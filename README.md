# searchSlopes
The spreadsheet allows playing around with various parameters that were suggested in various models of visual search (guidance, quitting rule, search-window size, dwell time). This is to demonstrate that all these parameters (and therefore all models containing various combinations of these parameters) can in principle explain search slopes equally well. The intuition one should get is that search slopes are not diagnostic for deciding between models or modes of visual search, thus challenging exactly this decade-old tradition in the visual-attention community.
